    <h2>Pulse</h2>
    <p> 
        The pulse or heart rate is the rate at which the heart beats while pumping blood through the arteries. 
        Its rate is usually measured either at the wrist or the ankle and is recorded as beats per minute. 
        The pulse commonly taken is from the radial artery at the wrist. 
        Sometimes the pulse cannot be taken at the wrist and is taken at the elbow (brachial artery), 
        at the neck against the carotid artery (carotid pulse), 
        behind the knee (popliteal artery), 
        or in the foot dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries. 
        The pulse rate can also be measured by listening directly to the heartbeat using a stethoscope. 
        The pulse varies with age. 
        A newborn or infant can have a heart rate of about 130–150 beats per minute. 
        A toddler's heart will beat about 100–120 times per minute, 
        an older child's heartbeat is around 60–100 beats per minute, 
        adolescents around 80–100 beats per minute, 
        and adults' pulse rate is anywhere between 50 and 80 beats per minute.
